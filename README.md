# traveler-pass
traveler is a digital QR code based bus pass system.
It tracks every passenger's journey in web app.
it registers the journey by showing a QR code from thw web app to the bus ticket conductor.
the conductor has a different account as comapred to the passenger where a QR code can be scanned.
Every time the QR code is scanned the a journey gets registered.
It does show the expiry date of the QR code based pass on the home page itself.
